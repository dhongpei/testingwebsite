# Tank Database/Website Scripts

## scripts&data
UI & Admin Scripts.py >>> Command line based program to aid an admin to login, query, and alter the testing database.
                          Commands located in sqlCommands can be used here, or manually inputted field-by-field.

index.py >>> A series of functions that would ideally be called by html code when specific actions are performed on the website.
             Each function represents one script that performs necessary queries on the database to send back relevant information
             to the webserver to display.

## sqlCommands

.sql files containing SQL commands for creating, destroying, and populating tables in the database.
Note: these are not proper scripts and are meant as copy/paste notes when working with a command line.
      See the scripts folder for ways to implement these commands.
